		   The principle of object-oriented programming we are about to examine is "abstraction". Abstraction means working
                   with something we know how to use without knowing how it works internally. Abstraction is one of the most 
                   important concepts in programming and OOP. It allows us to write code, which works with abstract data structures
                   (like dictionaries, lists, arrays and others). We can work with an abstract data type by using its interface 
                   without concerning ourselves with its implementation. The principle of abstraction helps to reduce redundant code
                   and create more maintainable code. Through the process of abstraction, a programmer can hide the relevent data
                   about an object and functions in a class from other classes. It helps the programmer to build secure programs. 
		   Even though HTML and CSS are not object oriented languages, abstract thinking is present in all of them. In HTML,
                   head element contains data that apply to each other element (like charset) and thus do not need to be repeated.
                   Attributes like class are then used in CSS to apply one style definition to all tags which contain that class. 
                   This is actually quite similar to python classes which "apply" defined variables and methods to all object of that
                   class.

	      <p>
		 Python has been an object-oriented language since it was developed. Because of this,
		 creating and using classes and objects are  easy. An object-oriented program is based on
		 classes and there exists a collection of interacting objects, as opposed to the conventional 
                 model, in which a program consists of functions and routines. In object-oriented programmming
                 (OOP), each object can receive messages, process data, and send messages to other objects.        
              </p>
		<p>
		 Objects are key to understanding object-oriented technology. Look around right now and you'll 
                 find many examples of real-world objects: your dog, your desk, your television set, your bicycle.
                 Software objects are conceptually similar to real-world objects: they too consist of state and
                 related behavior. An object stores its state in fields (variables in some programming languages) 
                 and exposes its behavior through methods (functions in some programming languages). Methods operate 
                 on an object's internal state and serve as the primary mechanism for object-to-object communication.
               </p>
		 <p>
                Object Oriented Programming is good for large projects because it allows a couple of key benefits 
		<ol>
                <li> It allows programmers to associate functions in the program using plain conversational language.
                   In OOPâ€™s programs functions and modules that are written by a user can be reused by other users
                   without any modification. Object created for Object Oriented Programs can easily be reused in other
                   programs.</li>
                <li> Repetitive functionality can be grouped in common elements and called on multiple times to reduce
                   coding repetition, making the program easier and faster to produce. </li>
		<li> Object Oriented Programming provides a clear modular structure for programs. It is good for 
                   defining abstract data types. Much like CSS provides a high level framwork to use for HTML page to
                   assist in formatting, classes in OOP can be used to define functionality that can be called on by
                   specific instances in your program. </li>

        <div class = "concept">
	   <h2 class = "concept-title"> Use Functions </h2>
	   <div class = "concept-description">
              <p>
                  A function is a named container for a block of code.   If functions are groups of code, then 
                  modules are groups of functions. We can write some program with using function and modules.
                  To use modules, we can use either the import or the from keyword. import is the simplest and 
                  most common keyword. There are plenty of built in modules, e.g. webbrowser, time,
                  os (operating system) etc.
              </p>
	      <p> 
                  * The webbrowser module includes functions to open URLs in interactive browser applications. 
                  To open a page in the browser, use the open() function. The webbrowser function takes in the 
                  link that you want to open and puts that link in quotes. When a module is first imported, 
                  Python searches for the module and if found, it creates a module object , initializing it.
              </p>
              <p> 
                  * Time module provides various time-related functions. Time module provides functions for working 
                  with times and for converting between representations. e.g. time.sleep(secs), time.ctime([sec]) etc.
                  time.sleep(secs) which suspends the program for a given numbers of seconds. time.ctime() shows 
                  current time on your computer. If secs is not provided or None, the current time as returned by 
                  time() is used. 
              </p>
              <p>
                  For example:suppose, we want to write a program that says take a break after every
                  hour to a somebody whose sits and works for long time. We can use our Python standard library
                  modules and write a take a break program. The library contains built-in modules that provide 
                  access to system functionality.
	       </p>
		   <ul>
	                <li> import webbrowser</li>
			<li> import time </li>
			<li> total_breaks = 3 &nbsp; # no. of breaks in whole day </li>
			<li> break_count = 0 
			<li> while break_count &lt;total_breaks: 
			<li> &nbsp;  time.sleep(10) # time in seconds 
			<li> &nbsp;  webbrowser.open("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KSOMA3QBU0") 
                        <li> &nbsp;  break_count = break_count + 1 </li>
  		   </ul>
		<p>
		   We don't know how functions open files from webbrowser,  or how the sleep function suspends the
                   program for seconds. All those things are hidden from us and that hiding of details in programming
                   is called <b>abstraction</b>. The idea of abstraction is really powerful in programming, because 
                   it allows us to focus on the program that we actually want to write, and it empowers us to use 
                   these functions simply by reading their documentations.
                 </p>
		<p> 
                   * So, much like webbrowser and time, Python has another module inside it called os, which is 
                   short for operating system. Inside os are several functions. Two of them are listdir, which lists 
                   out all the files in a given directory, and rename, which renames a given file.
                 </p>

                    In some cases, functions won't quite present a very eloquent solution. Functions are great to 
                    use when data is central to the work being done. Classes are great when you need to represent a
                    collection of attributes and methods that will be used over and over again in other places. 
                    Classes are a way to organize your code into generic, reusable pieces. At their best, 
                    they are generic blueprints for things that will be used over and over again with little
                    modification. What is needed is a way to group functions and variables that are closely related 
                    into one place so that they can interact with each other. These problems are what a thing called
                    object-oriented-programming solves. It puts functions and variables together in a way that they can
                    see each other and work together, be replicated, and altered as needed, and not when unneeded. 
                    And we use a thing called a 'class' to do this. A class is like a blueprint. It isn't something in
                    itself, it simply describes how to make something. You can create lots of objects from that
                    blueprint - known as an instance.

		   <h3 class = "concept-title"> Use Classes: Draw Turtles </h3>
		<p> 
                   There are many modules in pyhton that provide features that we can use to write program. Some
                   of these can draw shapes and patterns, can send email,or fetch web pages etc.

                   Turtle graphics is a popular way for introducing programming to kids. It was part of the original
                   Logo programming language. Turtle is like a drawing board. It has functions like turtle.forward(...)
                   and turtle.left(...) which can move the turtle around. Python has a library called turtle that is
                   part of the standard python installation. To use it, you need only type: from turtle import * or
                   import turtle <br> You can type this right in the python interpreter to experiment with turtle
                   graphics or, better yet, include this line at the top of your program and then use turtle drawing
                   commands in your program! In the turtle package when you run a program with turtle commands, a
                   special window will open where the drawing will take place.

                   There is a module in Python called turtle with a lowercase t. The turtle module provides turtle
                   graphics primitives, in both object-oriented and procedure-oriented ways. A class Turtle with an
                   uppercase T. A class as a neatly packaged box, that puts things together really well. And it allows
                   us to write code like turtle.Turtle(), which is calling a function __init__. init stands for
                   initialize, and what it does is it creates space in memory for a new instance or a new object of the
                   class Turtle. This instance we called brad. Brad can now acces all of the rest of the methods that
                   are inside class Turtle like forward, left,right.
 		</p>
		<ol>
	            <li> import turtle &nbsp;&nbsp; # Allows us to use turtles </li>
		    <li> def draw_shape(): </li>
		    <li> &nbsp; wn = turtle.Screen() &nbsp;&nbsp;# Creates a playground for turtles </li>
		    <li> &nbsp; brad = turtle.Turtle()&nbsp;&nbsp; # Create a turtle, assign to brad</li>
		    <li> &nbsp; brad.forward(50) &nbsp;&nbsp; # Tell brad to move forward by 50 units </li>
 		    <li> &nbsp; brad.left(90)   &nbsp;&nbsp; # Tell brad to turn by 90 degrees </li>
		    <li> &nbsp; wn.exitonclick() &nbsp;&nbsp; # Wait for user to close window </li>
		    <li> </li>
		    <li> draw_shape() </li>
		</ol>
		<p> 
                   Here are a couple of things we will need to understand about this program.<br> The first line 
                   tells Python to load a module named turtle. That module brings us two new types that we can use: 
                   the Turtle type, and the Screen type. The dot notation turtle.Turtle means "The Turtle type that is
                   defined within the turtle module" (Remember that Python is case sensitive, so the module name, with a
                   lowercase t, is different from the type Turtle.) We then create and open what it calls a screen 
                   (we would prefer to call it a window), which we assign to variable wn. Every window contains a
                   canvas, which is the area inside the window on which we can draw. In line 3 we create a turtle. 
                   The variable brad is made to refer to this turtle. So these first three lines have set things up,
                   we are ready to get our turtle to draw on our canvas.In lines 4-5, we instruct the object brad to
                   move, and to turn. We do this by invoking, or activating, brad's methods : these are the instructions
                   that all turtles know how to respond to.The line 6 : it enters a state where it waits for events
                   (like keypresses, or mouse movement and clicks). The program will terminate when the user closes the
                   window. And Last line calling the function that draw shape.
                 </p>
		<p> 
                   We know how classes group together variables and functions, known as attributes and methods, so that
                   both the data and the code to process it is in the same spot. We can create any number of instances
                   of that class, so that we don't have to write new code for every new object we create. To add extra
                   features to the other classes, Python makes inheritance really easy. We define a new class, based on
                   another, 'parent' class. Our new class brings everything over from the parent, and we can also add
                   other things to it. If any new attributes or methods have the same name as an attribute or method in
                   our parent class, it is used instead of the parent one.

                       In first line, we use Python keyword from. Keywords in Python are reservered words that cannot be
                       used as ordinary identifiers. from keyword explained that for importing a specific variable, class
                       or a function from a module. So, from twilio.rest import TwilioRestClient --> telling computer is
                       that inside Twilio, there is a folder called rest and inside that folder is a class called
                       twiliorestclient and use that class inside our code.Now, we know that when we downloaded Twilio, we
                       got, among other things, a folder called twilio. And inside that foler is a folder called rest.
                       Inside rest, is a python file, which has a class called TwilioRestClient. When we say
                       rest.TwilioRestClient(), we are calling the __init __function defined inside the class. And that
                       creates an instance or object. We call that instance client, and then we can do stuff with that
                       instance, like send SMSes.

		     How to detects curse words in a text or the draft of an email or an article? Firstly, you will have to read text

		   In above program, we did not import anything in our code for open function. In Python Documentation, it says that
                   open function opens a file, returns an object of the file type.In second line, when we wrote 
                   quotes = open(file_location)--> quotes is an object or an instance of the file. Eventhough, there is no class
                   involved, the code for open was actually implemented inside Python and calling some init-like function to create 
                   an object of file. Next, how can we check that there is a curse word in our text? There is a module in Python
                   called,URL lib, which helps us get information from the internet. It has a function called, URL open, which takes
                   in a link to a website. The function URL open, help us make a connection, to the website which is given by us for
                   profanity check. So, much like webbrowser,time and OS, urllib is also a module or a file in Python. And urlopen is
                   a function inside urllib module. This module provides a high-level interface for fetching data across the World
                   Wide Web. In particular, the urlopen() function is similar to the built-in function open(), but accepts Universal
                   Resource Locators (URLs) instead of filenames.

                   Certain functions and variables are related to each other very closely, and need to interact with each
                   other a lot. For example, imagine you want to build movie website of favorite movies and if you click on
                   one of them its trailer will play. It has all the information about movie(i.e. variables) like title,
                   youtube_trailer,storyline,poster_image,reviews etc.It also has functions associated with it. A function
                   only makes one output, not four or five, or five hundred. What is needed is a way to group functions and
                   variables that are closely related into one place so that they can interact with each other. Without
                   classes, you need to write a whole heap of code for each different movie. This is a pain, seeing that
                   all movie share common features, it is just that some have changed properties. The ideal situation would
                   be to have a design of your basic movie . Each time you create a new movie name, simply specify its
                   attributes. Wouldn't it be better if we were to just take our existing movie, and then tack the code for
                   the another movie? These problems that a thing called object-oriented-programming solves.

                    No code is run when you define a class - you are simply making functions and variables. The function
                    called __init__ is run when we create an instance of movie. It has two underscore on both sides of the
                    word init. The name init, is essentially reserved in python and this is a special function or method.
                    It intializes or creates space in memory. To remember details like title,storyline etc, for new movies
                    that we are about to create. init takes a arguments,and is always the python keyword, self.  self is
                    how we refer to things in the class from within itself. self is the first parameter in any function
                    defined inside a class. Any function or variable created on the first level of indentation (that is,
                    lines of code that start one TAB to the right of where we put class Shape is automatically put into
                    self. To access these functions and variables elsewhere inside the class, their name must be preceded
                    with self and a full-stop (e.g. self.variable_name).

                    this function as its name suggests, will open a browser and play the trailer of a movie. A function
                    that is defined inside a class and is associated with an instance is called an instance method.

	<p> <b> Vocabulary Words </b> </p>
	     <ul>
		<li><b> class:</b> Class can have both data and methods. You can think class as a blueprint. We can create
                        multiple objects(instances) of a class. The attributes are data members (class variables and
                        instance variables) and methods, accessed via dot notation. </li>
		<li><b> constructor: When we create an instances or a objects of a class, the classes constructor gets called.</li>
                <li><b> class variables :</b> A variable that is shared by all instances of a class. Class variables are
                        defined within a class but outside any of the class's methods. Class variables are not used as
                        frequently as instance variables are. </li>
	        <li><b> instance or object:</b> A unique instance of a data structure that's defined by its class. An
                        object comprises both data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods. </li>
	        <li><b> instance variables:</b> A variable that is defined inside a method and belongs only to the current
                        instance of a class.   </li>
	        <li><b> Method:</b> A special kind of function that is defined in a class definition. The first method
                        __init__() is a special method, which is called class constructor or initialization method that
                        Python calls when you create a new instance of this class.  </li>
                <li><b> self:</b> You declare other class methods like normal functions with the exception that the first
                        argument to each method is self. Python adds the self argument to the list for you; you do not
                        need to include it when you call the methods. </li>
	        <li> <b> instance method:</b> A function that is defined inside a class and is associated with an
                         instance is called an instance method. </li>
	        <li><b> inheritance:</b> The transfer of the characteristics of a class to other classes that are derived
                        from it. e.g. The child class inherits the attributes of its parent class, and you can use those
                        attributes as if they were defined in the child class. A child class can also override data
                        members and methods from the parent. </li>
